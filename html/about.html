            <p>
              We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane
              City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.
            </p>
            <p>
              ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness,
              with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML
              Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and
              improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life.
              Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet
              improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling
              better - we're here for you!
            </p>
            <p>
              ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including
              group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions
              for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers
              are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none â€“
              all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are a family operated business that has little to do with the
              rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the
              annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak
              for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word
              of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing
              machine dreams up. You are always welcome to look through any of
              our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With
              hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every
              corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that.
              Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with
              our $10 CASUAL visit rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that
              passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an
              old school feel with a new school attitude!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays,
              weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called
              24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night
              workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we
              are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out
              on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.

            <h2>About the owner and his philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I
              competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my
              knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to
              jump into the ring as your sparring partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing
              scene. He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now
              shares his knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his
              boxing classes with passion and enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly
              energised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level
              boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the
              best cardiovascular workouts available.
            </p>
