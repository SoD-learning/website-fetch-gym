3. **Form Design:** Developed a comprehensive web form with a minimum of seven fields, four different input types, input restrictions, labels, error divs, and a help function.
4. **Interactive Elements:** Introduced interactive elements like animated hover states for menu items, a help popup function, and an absolute or fixed position video element overlay on hover of the ‚Äòhelp‚Äô link.
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility and Validation:** Conducted thorough testing and debugging using browser developer tools, W3C Markup Validation Service, and cross-browser compatibility checks on at least two browsers and two devices.
6. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensured WCAG 2.1 Level-AA compliance through accessibility checking tools, addressing and fixing errors to meet accessibility standards.
7. **Cyber Security Measures:** Implemented cyber-security measures concerning the authentication process, programmatically engineered solutions to avoid cyber-attacks, and adhered to internet protocols for enhanced security.
8. **Client and Manager Interaction:** Engaged in project meetings and discussions with the client and manager to ensure alignment with the client‚Äôs requirements, and obtained sign-off upon project completion.
